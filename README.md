You can get all of these if you're a student. It helps to have a .edu email address

## For most institutions
Your school has probably told you about these already, but here goes anyway
* IEEE Student Membership - A lot of schools give you IEEE memberships, allowing you to view some of the nation's best STEM research work for free, when it would otherwise cost you about $50 per paper.
* MATLAB - a lot of schools, especially engineering colleges, sponsor a university-wide MATLAB license, allowing you to save thousands upon thousands of dollars
* Microsoft Office - most schools sponsor free Microsoft Office for all of their students.
* Google Drive - if your school has an educational Google Apps account, you have infinite storage (technically like 10 TB) on your account. You can save everything to your heart's content on that account.

## For a few institutions
Just a few schools have these
* Free Adobe Creative Cloud - some schools like UC Berkeley and Clemson have tie-ups with Adobe and can provide free Creative Cloud for their students.
* [Free Atlassian tools](https://www.atlassian.com/classroom) - some schools offer popular Atlassian tools for free. They help with code reviews, bug tracking and other such things.
